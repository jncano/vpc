direction*	string
Whether the traffic to be matched is inbound or outbound

Enum:
[ inbound, outbound ]
```

For example, the following value would be invalid because `northbound` is not a valid option in the enumeration `[ inbound, outbound ]`.

```json
{
    "direction":"northbound"
}
```

## validation_failure
